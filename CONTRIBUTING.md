## 🏗️ Architecture Guidelines

### Backend Architecture
- **API Layer**: FastAPI endpoints (`main.py`)
- **Business Logic**: Use case processing (`use_case_*.py`, `rag_utils.py`)
- **Data Layer**: Database operations (`db.py`)
- **Integration Layer**: Document parsing (`document_parser.py`)

### Frontend Architecture
- **Pages**: Main application views (`Dashboard`, `Extraction`, `Chat`)
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements (`FileUploader`, `UseCaseCard`)
- **State**: Zustand store for session management
- **API**: Client layer for backend communication

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Backend Testing
```bash
cd backend
pytest                          # Run all tests
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html  # Run with coverage
pytest -m unit                 # Unit tests only
pytest -m integration          # Integration tests only
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd frontend
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:coverage # With coverage report
npm run lint          # Check code style
```

### Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum Coverage**: 80% for all new code
- **Test Types**: Unit tests for functions, integration tests for workflows
- **Documentation**: All test cases should be self-explanatory
